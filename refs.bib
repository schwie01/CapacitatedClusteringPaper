abstract = {In this paper, we consider a class of constrained clustering problems of points in Rd, where d could be rather high. A common feature of these problems is that their optimal clusterings no longer have the locality property (due to the additional constraints), which is a key property required by many algorithms for their unconstrained counterparts. To overcome the difficulty caused by the loss of locality, we present in this paper a unified framework, called Peeling-and-Enclosing, to iteratively solve two variants of the constrained clustering problems, constrained k-means clustering (k-CMeans) and constrained k-median clustering (k-CMedian). Our framework generalizes Kumar et al.’s (J ACM 57(2):5, 2010) elegant k-means clustering approach from unconstrained data to constrained data, and is based on two standalone geometric techniques, called Simplex Lemma and Weaker Simplex Lemma, for k-CMeans and k-CMedian, respectively. The simplex lemma (or weaker simplex lemma) enables us to efficiently approximate the mean (or median) point of an unknown set of points by searching a small-size grid, independent of the dimensionality of the space, in a simplex (or the surrounding region of a simplex), and thus can be used to handle high dimensional data. If k and 1ϵ are fixed numbers, our framework generates, in nearly linear time (i.e., O(n(logn)k+1d)), O((logn)k)k-tuple candidates for the k mean or median points, and one of them induces a (1+ϵ)-approximation for k-CMeans or k-CMedian, where n is the number of points. Combining this unified framework with a problem-specific selection algorithm (which determines the best k-tuple candidate), we obtain a (1+ϵ)-approximation for each of the constrained clustering problems. Our framework improves considerably the best known results for these problems. We expect that our technique will be applicable to other variants of k-means and k-median clustering problems without locality.},

Our algorithm works with graphs having constant edge density, under an optimal condition on the gap between the density inside a block and the density between the blocks. As a co-product, we settle an open question posed by Abbe et. al. concerning  censor block models.}

abstract="Given a positive integer k and a complete graph with non-negative edge weights satisfying the triangle inequality, the remote-clique problem is to find a subset of k vertices having a maximum-weight induced subgraph. A greedy algorithm for the problem has been shown to have an approximation ratio of 4, but this analysis was not shown to be tight. In this paper, we use the technique of factor-revealing linear programs to show that the greedy algorithm actually achieves an approximation ratio of 2, which is tight.",
